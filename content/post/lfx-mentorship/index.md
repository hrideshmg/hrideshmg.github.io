This blog post has been long due but I've finally gotten around to it! I graduated from the Linux Kernel Bug Fixing Mentorship Programme'25 sometime in late january. I'll be detailing my experience about the same in this blog post

## What is the LKMP?
The Linux Kernel Mentorship programme or [LKMP](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/lkmp) for short is as written on their website -
> "A structured remote learning opportunity to aspiring Linux Kernel developers"

The programme that i was part of in specific was the Linux Kernel Bug Fixing programme, don't let the name fool you though, you can do a lot more than just fix bugs like write new device drivers or or make other kinds of contributions.

In short, its an opportunity where beginners to kernel dev can get their feet wet with the Linux Kernel while being supported by experienced mentors. Note that unlike GSoC or traditional [LFX](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship/) mentorships, the kernel bug fixing mentorship is an unpaid one but the knowledge you get from the whole process is worth its weight in gold.<br>
If however, you're someone who needs something more motivating than that you should probably look elsewhere as you can only ever do one LFX mentorship during your lifetime, choose wisely :)

## Why i decided to join the programme
There's actually a bit of an interesting backstory behind this, when i first bought my laptop (an Acer Nitro 5) and installed Linux on it (as one does with a brand new PC obviously) i noticed that no matter what i tried i just could not get the headphone jack to pick up the mic input. This is an issue that i had revisisted multiple times over the course of a year and it had even persisted across distros when i made the switch to Arch!
