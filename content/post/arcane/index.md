You ever just sit down after finishing a show, having this indescribable void inside you that you know can't be filled anytime soon? This was me at 2 AM yesterday after finishing Arcane. I can't quite put my finger on what the cause is — is it the realization that there aren't any more episodes? or the fact that this world that you grew so connected to has suddenly ceased to exist? (narrative wise anyways).

Whatever it is, it is definitely a unique experience. The last time I felt like this was after finishing the 1995 classic *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, a show that is still, to this day, very close to my heart. This blog post isn't really meant to be an exhaustive critique of the show, rather, it's just a personal reflection of some of the elements that I liked about it.

## The Animation
I don't think this is a field which needs much introduction, Arcane has over 16 [accolades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcane_(TV_series)#Accolades) for animation from various award ceremonies. One thing that really stood out to me in season 2 was the emphasis on the facial expressions of the characters. Paraphrasing a comment I saw on reddit — It actually felt like they were acting, 3D models, acting! You can notice their eyes glisten and twitch depending on the emotion that they are trying to express.

Fortiche have pretty much cemented themselves as pioneers with their distinctive style and attention to detail and I'm pretty excited to see what comes out of this studio next.

## The Characters
This is where the brilliance of the show really shines through. I could personally connect and empathize with a lot of characters in the show, their arcs are meaningful and full of emotion but they still feel very realistic. Almost each and every character in the show has flaws in one way or another and they all deal with their pain and trauma in *distinct* ways.

The show can be quite deep at times as well, with themes like revenge, betrayal, abandonment, loyalty, family, loss all showcased in their rawest form without any dilution. The writers really don't pull their punches here, so don't be surprised if a character you really like ends up in the casket a few episodes down.

## The Music/Sound Design
Arcane has hands down the best sound design I've seen in any animated show ever. The soundtrack is also really amazing, the songs are all really memorable and they really take impactful scenes to the next level, they are all written specifically for the show and they really do reflect the feelings of the characters in the scene.

Music when done right is actually one of my favourite aspects of media whether it be shows, movies or games just for the simple reason that listening to a song can evoke the same or similar emotion that you felt while actually experiencing the show for the first time.

## The World Building
As someone who hasn't really played the game much or has read any of the lore. The writers definitely managed to make the land of Piltover (and Runeterra in general) feel alive. I will always say that first and foremost, Arcane is a show about the characters but they have put a lot of work into the technical aspects as well. Even exploring concepts like time travel and parallel dimensions.

Sadly, it did feel a bit rushed at times, particularly during S2, but its understandable considering that they wanted to finish the story in two seasons.

## Conclusion
I have to say, I do feel a bit spoiled after watching this show. It's not everyday that you come across a piece of art that has had this much love and hardwork put into it.

I would wholeheartedely recommend Arcane no matter what kind of viewer you are. Don't let the fact that its an animated show put you off, since you would be missing out on one of the finest shows produced in this decade (maybe more)
