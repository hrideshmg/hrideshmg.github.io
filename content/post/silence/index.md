I sit here with my laptop wide open, in the darkness, the gentle hum of the ceiling fan and the slight blue pulse from the led of the wifi router being my only companion. 

There is no sound, except the one within my mind. Thoughts as they are - floating about, colliding and colluding, such is the nature of existence.

Sound may very well be the antithesis of introspection, a quiet retreat is a tough thing to find in this noisy and bustling world. Yet, I wish it was more common.

The external silence only serves to amplify the internal chaos; yet, without it, one wouldn't even realize the disarray within.
